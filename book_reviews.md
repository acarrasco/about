# Alejandro's book reviews

Here are some reviews for books related to our craft. Maybe I can encourage you to read (or skip) some.

## Software Engineering

### The Mythical Man-Month (Frederick P. Brooks)

This is a classic from the 70's, but most of it still holds up in the 2020's.

My key takeaways:

- Modern software engineering practices aren't as modern as we think.
- Complexity factors are multiplicative rather than additive.
- A small and highly focused team is best to crack the hard problems.
- There are always tradeoffs, and what holds true today might not hold true tomorrow.

### Matters Computational/FXT book (JÃ¶rg Arndt)

This is a great handbook for all kinds of "bit wizardry", combinatorics, numerical computing and close-to-the-metal optimizations.

Freely available as a PDF, it would make for a great "coffee table book", as it is very enjoyable to browse and let yourself be amazed by clever C implementations.

### Patterns of Software (Richard P. Gabriel)

Another "modern classic" from the 1990's; I would say it's more about the philosophy of software development rather than technical aspects.

My key takeaways:

- Software is like a home, make yourself comfortable.
- You need to find a balance between readability and compression.

## Management and soft skills

### How to Win Friends and Influence People (Dale Carnegie)

Most of it comes out as common sense, but it is a very enjoyable read nonetheless.

My key takeaways:

- Being a good person usually pays off.
- Empathy is a skill that can be practiced.

### How to Write and Speak Better (Reader's Digest)

This book is out of print and kind of difficult to find today, but you can find a pdf copy.

I first came across this book in the 90's in my local public library. There are many cultural references that are dated in the 2020's, but it is still full of great tips to improve clarity and communicate effectively.

### The Manager's Path (Camille Fournier)

It is most useful as a handbook or reference book to come back when you need guidance on how to perform a specific part of the job rather than a book that you read from beginning to end and then put away.

My key takeaways:

- You are not alone, every manager has gone through the same steps you are going. Do not be ashamed to ask for help to your more senior managers.
- The further you walk the path, the more detached you have to be from your reports.
