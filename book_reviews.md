# Alejandro's book reviews

Here are some reviews for books related to our craft. Maybe I can encourage you to read (or skip) some.

## Software Engineering

### The Mythical Man-Month (Frederick P. Brooks)

This is a classic from the 70's, but most of it still holds up in the 2020's.

My key takeaways:

- Modern software engineering practices aren't as modern as we think.
- Complexity factors are multiplicative rather than additive.
- A small and highly focused team is best to crack the hard problems.
- There are always tradeoffs, and what holds true today might not hold true tomorrow.

### Matters Computational/FXT book (JÃ¶rg Arndt)

This is a great handbook for all kinds of "bit wizardry", combinatorics, numerical computing and close-to-the-metal optimizations.

Freely available as a PDF, it would make for a great "coffee table book", as it is very enjoyable to browse and let yourself be amazed by clever C implementations.

### Patterns of Software (Richard P. Gabriel)

Another "modern classic" from the 1990's; I would say it's more about the philosophy of software development rather than technical aspects.

My key takeaways:

- Software is like a home, make yourself comfortable.
- You need to find a balance between readability and compression.

### The Pragmatical Programmer (Andrew Hunt and David Thomas)

If you are a seasoned developer, this book won't blow your mind. But it is full of good common-sense advice, so it might be a good idea to read it even if only to reinforce what you already knew.

I would definitely recommend it to junior developers and people getting into the craft.

### The Lean Startup (Eric Ries)

My manager got this book for the whole team when I was a software engineer working at Bazaarvoice; and I continued the tradition getting a copy for all my team whean I was a manager at Aircall.

The biggest issue I see with this book is that it is full of _survivor bias_ and does not seem to be aware of it.

My key takeaways:

- Be systematic about experimenting and measuring results
- Do not be afraid to correct course based on the experiments' results

### Game Programming Patterns (Robert Nystrom)

The gaming industry is very often overlooked in the "business" software engineering, but there is a lot to learn from video games (after all, games have always been pushing the boundaries of technology).

This book overlaps a lot with the classic "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", but has a much warmer tone and has plenty of practical examples of when (and when not) to apply each patterns in the context of game development.

It is a fun read, but do not expect to learn game-changing (pun intended) skills from it.

## Management and soft skills

### How to Win Friends and Influence People (Dale Carnegie)

Most of it comes out as common sense, but it is a very enjoyable read nonetheless.

My key takeaways:

- Being a good person usually pays off.
- Empathy is a skill that can be practiced.

### Atomic Habits (James Clear)

Very interesting read, it reminded me a lot in tone and structure to "How to Win Friends...". Again, there's nothing outrageously novel in the book, but it succeeds in teaching a systematic approach to habit building.

My key takeaways:

- Even the smallest progress is better than no progress (or going backwards).
- It pays off to put effort in making hard tasks easier rather than in the tasks themselves.

### How to Write and Speak Better (Reader's Digest)

This book is out of print and kind of difficult to find today, but you can find a pdf copy.

I first came across this book in the 90's in my local public library. There are many cultural references that are dated in the 2020's, but it is still full of great tips to improve clarity and communicate effectively.

### The Manager's Path (Camille Fournier)

It is most useful as a handbook or reference book to come back when you need guidance on how to perform a specific part of the job rather than a book that you read from beginning to end and then put away.

My key takeaways:

- You are not alone, every manager has gone through the same steps you are going. Do not be ashamed to ask for help to your more senior managers.
- The further you walk the path, the more detached you have to be from your reports.

### The Inner Game of Tennis (W. Timothy Gallwey)

Not sure if I can recommend this book for most software engineers. A big part of it is about getting into a _state of flow_, but I think any mindfulness handbook can guide you better about how to quiet the ego and be in the moment.

Still, the parts about listening to the body and observing in a non-judgmental way are useful for physical activities other than tennis. I feel I could have benefited from it **a lot** when getting my motorcycle riding license.
