# Alejandro Carrasco's README

## Welcome to the team!

If you are reading this the chances are that you've just joined my team, so welcome!

An engineering team is like a *band of brothers (and sisters)*, we are going to spend **a lot** of time together. Some of that time will be awesome (we will achieve amazing engineering feats, celebrate our wins, goof around, etc.), and there will be hard times too (debugging horrible legacy code, fixing outages in production, missing deadlines, etc.) but the important thing is we get each others's backs and we stick together.

## Who I am

I have a *Computer Engineering* (i.e. software engineering) degree at the University Carlos III of Madrid; majoring in *Distributed and Real Time Systems* (and minoring in *Artificial Intelligence*); and a Master's degree in *Computer Science and Technology* as well.

I was very close to getting entagled in obtaining a PhD, but ultimately decided that I wasn't cut for that.

I've worked in a variety of industries (Hardware IP, Finance, Gambling, Social Marketing), usually taking something new that I learnt in one job as the key skill to land the next one. So instead of specializing I have accumulated a lot of surface knowledge (you never know when that might come handy).

## Interacting with me

First of all, I have a terribly low [Empathy Quotient](https://psychology-tools.com/test/empathy-quotient) score. That doesn't mean at all that I don't care about people, just that I am a bit handicapped when it comes to interpret subtle social cues. So don't count too much on me reading between the lines or figuring out what's going on in your head all by myself!

One thing that gets to my nerves is receiving an instant message with just "Hello" and then keep waiting for me to reply before stating the subject. Let's save a round trip and deliver all the necessary information in one go! Likewise, don't feel like you have to ask about my day before requesting something from me; I appreciate social time and chit-chatting, but it stresses me out to know that you need something from me and are delaying it.


## The team idiosincrasies

- We do **a lot** of pair/mob programming
- We keep a shared document as a log of the team's progress
    - Filling it beforehand helps us to go not get stuck during the daily sync (so we can use that extra time in random shenanigans)
    - It helps people that couldn't attend to the sync to know what's going on
    - It helps to identify when people are stuck or getting interrupted a lot
- We love to argue because **we are passionate** and care about what we do
    - It is OK to disagree
    - It is not OK to hold a grudge over a disagreement, we all want what is best for the team
- Team time is never wasted time
    - If a daily sync goes for longer than usual because somebody wants to tell us about their day, or crack a joke, it is fine
    - If somebody is feeling overwhelmed with work and needs a break to grab some coffee, I encourage you to go tag along with them

## What I expect from you

- To be bold
- To be creative
- To enjoy what you do
- To have a great time with the team!
- To be eager for learning new things
- To be proud of what we are achieving together
- To have a sense of ownership
- To seek help if you are lost

## What you can expect from me

- To always make time for you
- To give you honest feedback
- To stand up for you
- To share any technical and personal advice that could help you (that graying hair must mean I'm getting wiser)
- To stay up late with you if there's an off-hours incident and you are the one that can fix it
- To pay for drinks every now and then (and pizza if we need to work off-hours)
- To catch you off guard with a joke when you least expect it
